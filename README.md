This case study is the *capstone project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certification*.In this case study I am working as the a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, *we are trying to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently*.From the insights our team will design new marketing stratergy of converting the casual riders into anual riders.
